Assignments

For assignments, please print out the source code that you have written (but not the code in the textbook or the code written by the instructor) as well as the output of your program.
Note that the input data in the questions are for checking. Your program should work for general input (and not only for the specified input).

In this semester, we will write several programs that process a large amount of numbers. The following files contain 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 random numbers that can be used as input: data 10, data 100, data 1000, data 10000.
Review of C

Examples to show structure and pointer variables point1.c,point2.c, point3.c. 
Simple error handling code fatal.h. 

1. The integers supported in a programming language is limited in size, usually to 32 bits. If you want to use integers above the limit, you need to write your own code. A large integer can be represented by a string over 0,1,2,...9. For example, string 12345678900987654321123456789009876543211234567890 represents a 50 digits integer. The input contains several lines. Each line starts with an interger, then either + or *, and then another integer. Assume the integer is 50 digits, and for simplicity, assume the second integer for multiplication is a single digit (between 0 and 9).

Sample input and output

12345678900987654321123456789009876543211234567890 + 56789009876543211234567890098765432112345678901234

a. Write functions for + and *.
b. Write a main function which calculates the result from the input, using functions implemented in a.

2. Reconsider the above question. Now the input integer size is not fixed. Solve the problem using linked list.

Linked list

Example code: list intersection.
Write programs for the following. Use the basic operations of (linked) list ADT, except (e). The list is initially empty and each step will use the list from the previous step.

     (a) read in the numbers in file data 100 and add to (an initially empty) list, keeping the order in data100
     (b) delete elements at even positions (of the list generated by step (a); suppose the element in the 1st real node (not header) is at the 0th position, the element in the 2nd real node is at the 1st position, the element in the 3rd real node is at the 2nd position,...). Use the basic operation DeleteNextNode(P,L). It deletes the node after P and has been added in linklist.c. 
     (c) check if number 100 is in the list 
     (d) print out the elements at odd positions of the list 
     (e) Add a basic operation that reverses a linked list by only changing the pointers (not by moving the data) and apply this operation to the list after (b) and repeat (d). 
     (f) Re-implement large integer using linked list ADT. 
     (g) Construct a linked list with elements 0,4,8,12,...,100, another linked list with 0,6,12,18,...,96. Write a program which constructs the union of the two lists (identical elements should occur only once) using basic operations. The resulted list should also be sorted and print it out.

(Practice class slide: List)

Stack


Some code on stack stack_link.h ,stack_link.c ,stack_array.h ,stack_array.c ,symbal_link.c ,symbal_array.c.

Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression. Assume the numbers are integers between 0 and 9, and the operators are + and *.

Queue


Some code on queue queue_array.h ,queue_array.c ,testque_array.c.

Implement the contiguous queue ADT with size field removed. Run the test program testque_array.c. 
Implement the remaining basic operations of queue by linked list. The header file is queue_link.h, and code for some operations is in queue_link_ex.c. Modify the test program testque_array.c to run it on linked list implementation. 
Hashing


Some code on hashing hashsep.h, hashsep.c, hashquad.h, hashquadcorr.c.

Use separate chaining, table size next prime number after 50. Read in the numbers in file data 100 and insert into (an initially empty) hash table, and check if the numbers 100, 1201 and 26966 are in the table and print out the number of probes for each search operation. Use the simple hash function h(x)=x % TableSize. Print out all elements in the table list by list.
Repeat 1, using open addressing with quadratic probing, table size next prime number after 200 (no need to print out all elements).
Add a basic operation which deletes a key from the hash table with separate chaining. Use this operation to delete even position numbers of the input file from the hash table obtained in step 1.
Trees


Some code on binary tree tree.h, tree.c.

Insert numbers in data 100 in a binary search tree.
Print out the numbers in the tree after step 1 in inorder and check if the numbers are sorted.
Delete the numbers at positions 5, 10, 15,... 5*i... (as usual, the first number is assumed to be at position 0) of file data 100 from the search tree and repeat step 2.
Implement the operations FindMin, Find and Insert without using recursion and repeat 1, 2 and 3 using the new implementation.
